# preserved-heritage-project
Website project made for the "Übung - Preserve our shared Cultural Heritage - Recorded data, writing systems, scripts" at the University of Cologne for the summer semester 2024

**Korean Story (Title subject to change)**

Introduction to Korean writing system with a pinch of history
- HTML, CSS & JavaScript webapp to learn how to write Hangul-Characters

## Main Ideas
- Video → Korean scripts, letters and language
- Text → Korean writing systems
- TRY IT OUT YOURSELF:
  - Boxes of the korean alphabet
  - clickable, to another page, where you can draw the lines (or shows how to draw it)

## Optional ideas
- Memory game (maybe)/lines connect / interactive mini-game “to learn”
- We can add a feature to build syllable blocks using the Jamo Korean unicode block/or the regular one
